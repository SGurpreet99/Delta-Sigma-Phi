      <div class="caption">It is our honor to recognize our brother Robert Terhell as this weeks better man. Robert is the textbook definition of what it means to be the better man. Joining back in Fall ‘17 Robert instantly took up treasurer for our executive board and slowly work his way up to become our chapters president.His awards and accolades are lucrative in and outside the brotherhood. However there is one award of Robert’s that we would love to highlight. This past weekend at our national convention. Robert was awarded with the E. Allen James award, this award is only given once every two years to one outstanding undergraduate member from all the Delta Sig chapters around the nation. For everything that Robert has given to our Gamma Epsilon chapter, he has helped elevate our chapter to one of the bests in the nation and our chapter will forever be grateful for that ! And we are damn proud for Robert Terhell to be a member of Delta Sig! </div>

It has opened many doors that I never would have imagined and I have been able to learn how to be a leader within this organization as well organizations on campus.

        “Delta Sigma Phi has shaped me into the person I am today. Before joining this brotherhood I had no direction as to what I wanted to do or accomplish. With the immense knowledge that I have gained from the members of this brotherhood I have taken on several leadership positions within Delta Sigma Phi as well as other organizations throughout campus life. These experiences have truly been humbling and has changed my life for the better. I am extremely grateful of this family who has given me so much and I hope to continue to grow and stay hungry for success. Ever proud to be a Delta Sig.”
